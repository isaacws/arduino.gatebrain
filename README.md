# gatebrain
Gate Brain is an open source gate controller that can attach to any actuator and provide remote connectivity and control.
Gate Brain utilizes a state machine to transition between states and control the gate actuator.
* Bump detection with current monitoring
* Soft start and stop
* Time based swing times with close/open detection (detects current spikes in soft stop and assumes it hit the limit of the gate swing)
* Manual open/close button support
